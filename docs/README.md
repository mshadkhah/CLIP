CLIP: A CUDA-Accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Framework for Interfacial Phenomena

**CLIP** is a high-performance, extensible Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) library developed in C++/CUDA, designed to simulate interfacial phenomena such as bubbles, drops, and jets in both 2D and 3D domains.

It features a modular, GPU-accelerated architecture that enables **easy integration of additional physical models and equations**. Thanks to its flexible design, **adding new models or equations requires minimal effort**, making it ideal for extending to novel research problems.

Moreover, **CLIP is highly optimized**, allowing users to run many simulations ‚Äî including 3D multiphase problems ‚Äî **on a personal computer without requiring a high-end GPU**. For memory-constrained or low-end GPUs, users can **enable single precision** to significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance. With its fully configurable input system, CLIP is ideal for rapid prototyping, educational use, and scalable research.
