<h1 align="center"><strong> CLIP: A CUDA-Accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Framework for Interfacial Phenomena</strong></h1>

**CLIP** is a high-performance, extensible Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) library developed in C++/CUDA, designed to simulate interfacial phenomena such as bubbles, drops, and jets in both 2D and 3D domains. It features a modular, GPU-accelerated architecture that enables easy integration of additional physical models and equations. Thanks to its flexible design, adding new models or equations requires minimal effort, making it ideal for extending to novel research problems.

Moreover, **CLIP is highly optimized**, allowing users to run many simulations ‚Äî including 3D multiphase problems ‚Äî **on a personal computer without requiring a high-end GPU**. For memory-constrained or low-end GPUs, users can **enable single precision** to significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance, making it possible to simulate larger domains efficiently. With its fully configurable input system, users can explore diverse simulation scenarios without modifying code, making **CLIP** an ideal tool for rapid prototyping, educational use, and scalable research.

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- CUDA 8.0+
- CMake ‚â• 3.18
- GCC ‚â• 9
- NVIDIA GPU (e.g., V100, A100, RTX, or even entry-level GPUs)
- Python for post-processing (optional)

### Build

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/CLIP.git
cd CLIP
```

**2. Create and enter a build directory**
```bash
 2. Create and enter a build directory
mkdir build && cd build
```

**3. Configure with CMake**

 2D simulation in double precision (default)
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_2D=ON
```

3D simulation in double precision
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_3D=ON
```
On low-end GPUs or memory-constrained systems, you can enable single precision to reduce memory usage and fit larger meshes within the available GPU memory.
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_2D=ON -DUSE_SINGLE_PRECISION=ON
```

**4. Build the executable**
```bash
make -j
```

## Configuration Format

CLIP simulations are driven by a flexible, text-based `config.txt` file. Here's a sample configuration for a 2D drop impact simulation:

```ini
case = drop
finalStep = 100000
outputInterval = 1000
reportInterval = 1000
checkpointInterval = 1000
checkpointCopy = 5

N = [64, 128, 1]         # Grid size (X, Y, Z)
referenceLength = 25     # Used for dimensionless parameter scaling

We = 5                   # Weber number
Re = 100                 # Reynolds number
gravity = [0, -1e-6, 0]  # Gravity vector
mobility = 0.02
interfaceWidth = 4
muRatio = 100            # Viscosity ratio (Œº_high / Œº_low)
rhoRatio = 1000          # Density ratio (œÅ_high / œÅ_low)

geometry = [
  {
    type = "circle"
    center = [32, 20, 0]
    radius = 10
    id = 0
  }
]

boundary = [
  { side = "x-", type = "periodic" },
  { side = "x+", type = "periodic" },
  { side = "y-", type = "wall" },
  { side = "y+", type = "wall" }
]
```

Each simulation can define geometry, boundary conditions, and physical parameters without recompiling the code. This makes CLIP well-suited for quick experimentation and parameter sweeps.

### Capabilities
**CLIP** is a flexible and high-performance Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) framework designed to simulate a variety of interfacial phenomena. The framework is built with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend with new physical models, equations, and simulations. The code is written in such a way that users can seamlessly integrate additional equations or models, allowing for rapid prototyping and adaptation to new research areas.



| Category              | Support                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| **LB Equations**       | Navier‚ÄìStokes, Allen‚ÄìCahn       |
| **LBM Models**         | Weighted MRT                   |
| **Lattice Structures** | D2Q9 (2D), D3Q19 (3D)           |
| **Geometry via SDF**   | Circle, Sphere, Square, Cube, Perturbation |
| **Initial Conditions** | Bubble, Drop, Jet, RTI, etc.   |
| **Boundary Conditions**| Periodic, Wall, Slip-Wall, Neumann, Velocity, Free Convective, Do-Nothing |
| **Restart / Checkpoint** | ‚úÖ Yes                        |
| **Outputs**            | ASCII VTK, Binary Checkpoints  |


We have implemented a comprehensive set of boundary conditions in **CLIP**, covering most of the typical scenarios encountered in LBM simulations:

- **Periodic Boundaries** ‚Äì For domains with repeating patterns (e.g., channel or jet flows).
- **Wall Boundaries** ‚Äì Includes **half-way bounce-back** modeling for enhanced accuracy and stability, especially at **high Reynolds numbers**.
- **Slip-Wall Boundaries** ‚Äì Allow tangential fluid motion with no normal penetration; useful for idealized smooth-wall flows.
- **Neumann Boundaries** ‚Äì Prescribed gradient (zero-gradient) at the boundary; used in thermal or scalar transport simulations.
- **Velocity Boundaries** ‚Äì Supports imposed velocity profiles on inlets/outlets or moving boundaries.
- **Free Convective Boundaries** ‚Äì Models fluid-wall interaction with convective behavior (useful in natural convection setups).
- **Do-Nothing Boundaries** ‚Äì Apply when the simulation does not need to enforce any condition on the boundary.

These options ensure **CLIP** can handle a wide range of real-world and research-driven multiphase flow scenarios. **CLIP** utilizes a **Weighted MRT** model for better numerical stability and accuracy over standard BGK. It supports **Navier‚ÄìStokes** and **Allen‚ÄìCahn** equations, making it suitable for simulating two-phase flows with interfacial dynamics. With **D2Q9** and **D3Q19** lattices, the framework is adaptable to complex domains and phenomena. Output is provided in VTK for visualization and binary format for efficient checkpointing and restart.
